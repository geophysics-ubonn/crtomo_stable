prepare sgsim:
1. grid info <- CutMcK on elem/elec, via function get_grid_info <ctmck.info-file>
2. log info <- user defined (maybe automatic, too) 
3. variogram info <- semi automatic. defined or fitted within stochastic_sim.sh / *_fit_sim.sh

1. prepare script which checks for the grid info (path to the ctmck.info file) and takes _log_ and _variogram_ info as arguments..

log would be <xlog> <dxlog> <ylog> <dylog> , mean would be calculated.. (??)
variogram would be <var-type> <nugget> <variance> <amin> <amax> <angle>
