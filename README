Installation
------------

If you are working with a git repository, run

./autogen.sh

once to generate the necessary autotools files.

Otherwise, configure, compile, and install the program with

# ./configure
# make
# make install

The default installation path points to /usr. You can change the installation
directory with

# ./configure --prefix=$HOME/inst/

Run

# ./clean_autotools.sh

to remove all auto-generated files.

Distribution
------------

After running ./configure, a source archive called "crtomomod*.tar.gz" can be
generated using

# make dist

Debian Packaging
----------------

The command

# ./prep_deb_package.sh

creates a Debian package in the "package/" subdirectory.

Limiting CPU usage
------------------

CRTomoMod is compiled using openmp. The number of CPU cores that are
facilitated can be controlled using the following environment variables:

export OMP_THREAD_LIMIT=1
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
export OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1
